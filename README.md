# Classification-of-hand-written-vowels

A vowel database of 120 different handwritten vowels is available. The program extracts features based on which the letters will be correctly classified into the appropriate classes. The program is trained with the training set and tested with the test set. The confusion matrix shows the classification results. :memo:
